# 🧠 Project Insight: Natural Language-Driven Data Analysis

**Project Insight** is a no-code, AI-powered data analysis platform that enables users to interact with structured and unstructured datasets (CSV, Excel, PDF, Word) using natural language. It features a Streamlit frontend and a FastAPI backend powered by Google's Gemini LLM.

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Frontend:** Streamlit (`frontend/`)
- **Backend:** FastAPI (`backend/`)

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Upload files in **CSV**, **XLSX**, **PDF**, or **DOCX** format  
- ✅ Automatically parse and preview your data  
- ✅ Ask natural language questions like:  
  - “Is there a trend in sales over months?”  
  - “What’s the average order value?”  
  - “Group products by category and show totals”  
- ✅ Answers generated by **Google Gemini AI**  
- ✅ Clean and simple UI using **Streamlit**  
- ✅ Fast backend with **FastAPI**

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Upload a data file (CSV, Excel, PDF, or Word) using the sidebar.  
2. Backend parses the file and returns structured content to the frontend.  
3. User asks a question in plain English.  
4. Gemini AI analyzes the data and query.  
5. Human-readable, intelligent response is returned.

## 🛠️ Full Setup Instructions (If Not Using Separate Folders)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hetvipatel31/project-insight.git
cd project-insight
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r req.txt
```

### 3. Set Up API Key

Create a `.env` file in the root or backend folder:

```ini
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
```

> 🔐 You can get your Gemini API key from [Google MakerSuite](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

### 4. Run the Backend (FastAPI)

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

> Runs on: `http://localhost:8000`

### 5. Run the Frontend (Streamlit)

In a **new terminal**:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

> Runs on: `http://localhost:8501`

## 💬 Sample Queries You Can Ask

- “Which month had the highest total revenue?”  
- “Show me average delivery time by category”  
- “List all orders greater than $1000”  

---

## 🧠 How Prompting Works

The backend sends a smart prompt to Gemini like:

> “You are a smart data assistant. Given the dataset and the user query, analyze trends, perform calculations, and provide clear responses with reasoning...”

This ensures versatile support for:

- Grouping and aggregation  
- Statistical summaries  
- Trends and pattern recognition  
- Filtering and sorting  
- Data transformation
